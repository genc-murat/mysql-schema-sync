# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves enhancing the visual presentation and user experience of the mysql-schema-sync CLI tool. The improvements will focus on making the output more readable, visually appealing, and user-friendly through better formatting, colors, progress indicators, and interactive elements.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to see colorized and well-formatted output, so that I can quickly identify different types of schema changes and their importance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI displays schema differences THEN the system SHALL use color coding to distinguish between additions (green), deletions (red), and modifications (yellow)
2. WHEN showing table changes THEN the system SHALL use consistent color schemes and formatting for better readability
3. WHEN displaying column information THEN the system SHALL use indentation and visual separators to show hierarchy
4. WHEN showing SQL statements THEN the system SHALL apply syntax highlighting for better code readability
5. IF the terminal doesn't support colors THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to plain text with clear visual separators

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to see progress indicators during long operations, so that I know the tool is working and can estimate completion time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to databases THEN the system SHALL display a spinner or progress indicator
2. WHEN extracting schema information THEN the system SHALL show progress with current operation details
3. WHEN comparing schemas THEN the system SHALL display progress for large databases
4. WHEN applying changes THEN the system SHALL show a progress bar with completed/total operations
5. IF an operation takes longer than expected THEN the system SHALL provide status updates and estimated time remaining

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to see structured and organized output with clear sections, so that I can easily navigate through the information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL organize output into clear sections with headers and separators
2. WHEN showing schema differences THEN the system SHALL group related changes together with collapsible sections
3. WHEN displaying table information THEN the system SHALL use tables or structured layouts for better data presentation
4. WHEN showing summaries THEN the system SHALL highlight key statistics and important information
5. IF there are many changes THEN the system SHALL provide pagination or scrollable sections

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want interactive confirmation dialogs with clear options, so that I can make informed decisions about applying changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN prompting for confirmation THEN the system SHALL display a clear dialog with highlighted options
2. WHEN showing destructive operations THEN the system SHALL use warning colors and icons to draw attention
3. WHEN listing changes to apply THEN the system SHALL allow users to review individual changes before confirming
4. WHEN displaying warnings THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visual indicators (icons, colors, borders)
5. IF users need to make complex decisions THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information in an organized format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want customizable output formats and verbosity levels, so that I can adapt the tool to different use cases and preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the tool THEN the system SHALL support multiple output formats (table, json, yaml, compact)
2. WHEN using verbose mode THEN the system SHALL provide detailed information with enhanced formatting
3. WHEN using quiet mode THEN the system SHALL show minimal but well-formatted essential information
4. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support exporting formatted output to files
5. IF users have accessibility needs THEN the system SHALL support high-contrast modes and screen reader friendly output

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to see visual icons and symbols that help me quickly understand the type and severity of changes, so that I can prioritize my attention effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying change types THEN the system SHALL use consistent icons for additions (‚ûï), deletions (‚ûñ), and modifications (üîÑ)
2. WHEN showing severity levels THEN the system SHALL use visual indicators for critical (üî¥), warning (üü°), and info (üîµ) messages
3. WHEN displaying database objects THEN the system SHALL use appropriate icons for tables (üìã), columns (üìÑ), and indexes (üîç)
4. WHEN showing status information THEN the system SHALL use checkmarks (‚úÖ) for success and X marks (‚ùå) for failures
5. IF the terminal doesn't support Unicode THEN the system SHALL fall back to ASCII alternatives (+, -, *, etc.)
