# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a CLI program in Go that compares two MySQL databases (source and target) to detect schema differences, presents a summary of changes, and applies approved changes to the target database. The program will handle schema evolution scenarios where fields may have been added, removed, or modified over time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to compare schema differences between two MySQL databases, so that I can understand what changes need to be synchronized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CLI program is executed with source and target database connection parameters THEN the system SHALL connect to both databases successfully
2. WHEN both database connections are established THEN the system SHALL retrieve complete schema information from both databases
3. WHEN schema information is retrieved THEN the system SHALL compare tables, columns, indexes, and constraints between source and target
4. WHEN schema comparison is complete THEN the system SHALL identify added, removed, and modified database objects
5. IF connection to either database fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message and exit gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to see a clear summary of schema differences, so that I can review what changes will be applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema differences are detected THEN the system SHALL display a structured summary of all changes
2. WHEN displaying changes THEN the system SHALL categorize them as additions, deletions, and modifications
3. WHEN showing table changes THEN the system SHALL display table name, change type, and affected columns
4. WHEN showing column changes THEN the system SHALL display column name, data type, constraints, and change details
5. WHEN showing index changes THEN the system SHALL display index name, type, and affected columns
6. IF no differences are found THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating schemas are synchronized

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want to approve changes before they are applied, so that I can prevent unintended modifications to the target database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN schema differences are displayed THEN the system SHALL prompt for user confirmation before applying changes
2. WHEN user confirms changes THEN the system SHALL proceed with applying modifications to target database
3. WHEN user rejects changes THEN the system SHALL exit without making any modifications
4. WHEN applying changes THEN the system SHALL execute SQL statements in the correct order to avoid dependency conflicts
5. IF any SQL execution fails THEN the system SHALL stop execution and report the error with context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want the program to handle different types of schema changes safely, so that data integrity is maintained during synchronization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding new tables THEN the system SHALL create tables with all columns, indexes, and constraints
2. WHEN adding new columns THEN the system SHALL add columns with appropriate default values and constraints
3. WHEN modifying existing columns THEN the system SHALL alter column definitions while preserving data when possible
4. WHEN removing columns THEN the system SHALL drop columns safely
5. WHEN removing tables THEN the system SHALL drop tables and handle foreign key dependencies
6. WHEN modifying indexes THEN the system SHALL drop and recreate indexes as needed
7. IF a destructive operation is detected THEN the system SHALL warn the user and require explicit confirmation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a database administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can troubleshoot issues and track changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any database operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error with sufficient detail for troubleshooting
2. WHEN SQL statements are executed THEN the system SHALL log each statement for audit purposes
3. WHEN the program encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages
4. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL log a summary of applied changes
5. IF the program is interrupted THEN the system SHALL handle graceful shutdown without leaving the database in an inconsistent state
